2. **Business Units Table**: Describes different business units, including their divisions and executive IDs.
3. **Date Table**: Contains temporal data such as years, periods, dates, and quarters for time-based analysis.
4. **Scenario Table**: Outlines different scenarios for comparison, typically actual versus budget.
5. **Product Table**: Identifies various products offered by the business.
6. **Customers Table**: Profiles customers by their names, locations, industries, and countries/regions.
7. **Industry Table**: Categorizes industries with corresponding IDs and images.
8. **Executive Table**: Lists executives with their respective IDs and images.
9. **State Table**: Provides information on states including their codes, regions, and names.

## Key Analyses
### 1. Revenue and Profitability Analysis
- **Revenue Variance**: Primus has the highest positive revenue variance, while (Blank) shows the most negative variance.
- **Gross Margin**: Gross Margin has increased over time, with the Services industry providing the highest revenue.
- **Product Performance**: Primus and Gladius are top revenue-generating products. 

### 2. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Analysis
- **COGS Variance**: Primus has the highest COGS variance, indicating significant cost fluctuations.

### 3. Customer Insights

- **Unregistered Customers**: Unregistered customers, though fewer, contribute significantly to revenue.

### 4. Product Analysis
- **High Revenue, Low Margin**: Products like Primus have high revenue but lower Gross Margin percentages due to higher costs.
